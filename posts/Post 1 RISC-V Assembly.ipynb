    "# RISC-V Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) is an [instruction set architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) designed to be simple and extensible.\n",
    "These design principles, as well as it being an open standard, made it a popular target for computer science research, and it's slowly picking up steam as a platform for personal computers and accelerators in industry.\n",
    "As part of my PhD, I am working on writing a compiler for neural networks targeting AI accelerators that extend the RISC-V ISA, with the neural networks and accelerator hardware developed by other partners in [CONVOLVE](https://convolve.eu/).\n",
    "This is the first of a series of blog posts describing how to write such a compiler in Python, using open-source frameworks such as [riscemu](https://github.com/antonlydike/riscemu) and [xDSL](https://xdsl.dev/)."
